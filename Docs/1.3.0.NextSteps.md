Next Steps
=====

After implementing the Getting Started section of the [README.md](../README.md), this section will describe the changes needed to produce a working VDS-NC document.

> **IMPORTANT:** VDS-NC is a library, not an application. The application using the VDS Suite library will need to implement its own interfaces and security.

## Use a Signing Service

Signing a VDS-NC allows a reader application to verify that VDS-NC is authentic and has not been tampered. The Proof of Vaccination use case published by ICAO requires a digital signature.

Methods of storing and using cryptographic keys vary significantly between applications. For this reason, VDS Suite expects developers to implement aspects of their own signing service.

Your options for this are described in: [1.3.1 Next Steps - Signing Service](./1.3.1.NextSteps-SigningService.md).

## Use a Document Service

The Getting Started example uses the `BarcodeOnlyDocumentService` which produces a VDS-NC barcode image.

Using a different document service will enable you to easily embed the barcode into a document and list additional information which can be read without the need of a barcode scanner. This information cannot replace the signed VDS-NC data, but it will assist the document holder and officials in understanding and using the VDS-NC.

Your options for document services are described in: [1.3.2 Next Steps - Document Service](./1.3.2.NextSteps-DocumentService.md).
