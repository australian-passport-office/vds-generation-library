Pre-processor Service
========

Preprocessor services provide initial transformations to the inputted VDS object. 

## Interface: `IPreProcessorService<TVdsMessage>`

### Method: `PreProcess(Vds<TVdsMessage> vds, Dictionary<string, object> additionalInformation)`

#### Description

Applies the transformations to the given `Vds<TVdsMessage>` and stores any additional information about the transformation in the `additionalInformation` dictionary.

#### Input

| Field | Type | Description | Note |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| vds | `Vds<TVdsMessage>` | The VDS object to transform  | Required | 
| additionalInformation | `Dictionary<string, object>` | Supporting information. The pre-processor may store additional information into this dictionary | Optional | 

#### Output

Type | Description | 
| --- | --- |
| `Vds<TVdsMessage>` | The VDS object  |

## Implementation: `PovPreProcessorService<TVdsMessage>`

### Description

This implements the `PreProcess()` method, which is used to limit the total number of doses included in a Proof of Vaccination VDS-NC. If the number of doses is below the provided `MaxDoses` threshold, then no change is made. If the number of doses is above the `MaxDoses` threshold, then doses are removed in order of dose number until the number of doses equals the `MaxDoses` threshold.

If the `additionalInformation` parameter is included, the following keys are added to the `additionalInformation` dictionary and passed to future services.

Key | Value Type | Value | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| IsTruncated | `bool` | True if turncation occurred |
| MaxDoses | `int` | The number truncated to |
| OriginalEventCount | `int` | Number of vaccination events before truncation |
| OriginalDoseCount | `int` | Number of vaccination details (doses) before truncation |
| TruncatedEventCount | `int` | Number of vaccination events after truncation |
| TruncatedDoseCount | `int` | Number of vaccination details (doses) after truncation |

### Configuration

```json
{
  "VisibleDigitalSeal": {
    "PreProcessorServiceOptions": {
      "TruncateDosesByCount": bool,
      "MaxDoses": int
    }
  }
}

```
| Field | Type | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TruncateDosesByCount | bool | If true, the total number of doses will be reduced to `MaxDoses` | false | 
| MaxDoses | int | The limit to reduce doses to | 6 | 

### Extension

`PovPreProcessorService<TVdsMessage>` provides overridable methods to allow developers to change how doses are selected during dose truncation and how the changes are recorded.

#### Overriding Dose Selection

Overriding `PovPreProcessorService<TVdsMessage>.GetDosePriority(...)` allows developers to select which doses are included in a truncated VDS-NC.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| events | `IEnumerable<PovVaccinationEvent>` | All `PovVaccinationEvent` objects in the original VDS-NC | 
| vaccEvent | `PovVaccinationEvent` | The target dose's `PovVaccinationEvent` |
| vaccination | `PovVaccinationDetails` | The target dose (`PovVaccinationDetails`) |
| \<output\> | `int` | Returns a priority score. Doses with the lowest score are removed first |

#### Overriding Change recording

When a truncation occurs, the `RecordTruncationData` method stores information about the truncation into the `additionalInformation` dictionary. This dictonary is supplied to other services, including the document rendering services.

Overriding `PovPreProcessorService<TVdsMessage>.RecordTruncationData(...)` allows developers to change how this information is recorded.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vds | `Vds<TVdsMessage>` | The VDS-NC object that was truncated |
| additionalInformation | `Dictionary<string, object>` | The supplied additionInformation dictionary |
| originalEventCount | `int` | The number of vaccination events before truncation |
| originalDoseCount | `int` | The number of vaccination details (doses) before truncation |
| truncatedEventCount | `int` | The number of vaccination events after truncation |
| truncatedDoseCount | `int` | The number of vaccination details (doses) after truncation |
