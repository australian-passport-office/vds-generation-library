Document Service
========

The document service renders a vaccination certificate or similar document which contains a VDS-NC barcode.

## Implementation: `BarcodeOnlyDocumentService<TVdsMessage>`
-----

#### Description

The `BarcodeOnlyDocumentService` is used to complete the VDS workflow when a document is not required. This provides a consistent format for results where an application might produce multiple output types.

This service effectively wraps an `IBarcodeResult<TVdsMessage>` in an `IDocumentResult<TVdsMessage>`. It is an equally valid solution to build your own workflow which does not use an `IDocumentService` and simply returns an `IBarcodeResult<T>`
